# CSS Grid Video Course

These are my completed files for the CSS Grid course offered by Wes Bos, you can find the full course, starter files and completed solutions at [CSSGrid.io](https://CSSGrid.io). 


## Personal Development

I took this course as I have worked with CSS Grid before briefly, but wanted to both test my skills and as well as enhance them further. It has offered me great understanding and helped me apply it into both new and existing projects; both personal and professional. 

## Tools & Experience

I used `npm` and `browsersync` as the tools for set up, and I chose to install `nodemon` when suggested, as it made my workflow more efficient.
